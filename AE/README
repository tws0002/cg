Scripts for After Effects.

Here is a quick description of the ones not unique to my studio's internal workflow:

Render to Console (Multi):
Renders all active items in your render queue to the console using multiple threads.  (Close AE once it's running.)

Render to Console (Single):
Renders all active items in your rener queue to the console using a single thread.  (Close AE once it's running.)

Convert Quicktime to rec709:
Select any quicktimes in your project window, and when the script is run they will be added to your render queue at broadcast rec709 specs.
(16-235 black/white, 59.94 framerate)
Modifications are fairly straightforward.
